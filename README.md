## Hi, I'm Larissa. My specialty is solving puzzles. :jigsaw: 

... so no wonder I love programming.
I've worked with several technologies, but my favourite are the following:

- Python
- C#
- Azure
- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Solidity
- Truffle

I'm currently working on deepening my automation and deployment skills. So these include experimenting with:
- GitHub Actions
- CircleCI
- Docker
